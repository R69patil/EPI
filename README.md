# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. The code is organized into subdirectories based on the category of the data structure or algorithm.

## Organization

The main source code is located in the `EPI/src` directory. Within this directory, you'll find subdirectories such as:

- `Arrays`: Implementations of algorithms related to arrays.
- `Linked_List`: Implementations of different types of linked lists and related algorithms.
- `Recursion`: Examples of recursive algorithms.
- `String`: Algorithms for string manipulation and processing.
- `ALL_Sorting_Algorithm`: Various sorting algorithms.
- `Primitive_type`: Operations on primitive data types.
- `LeetCode_problem`: Solutions to selected LeetCode problems.
- `Pratice_Problem`: A collection of practice problems.

Each subdirectory contains Java files with the respective implementations.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal collection of data structure and algorithm implementations for learning and practice. It's a valuable resource for understanding fundamental computer science concepts and improving problem-solving skills.

Feel free to explore the code and use it for your own learning purposes.
