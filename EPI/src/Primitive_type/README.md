# Primitive Type Operations

This directory contains Java implementations of operations and algorithms related to primitive data types, primarily focusing on bitwise manipulations and arithmetic operations.

Below is a list of the implemented algorithms:

- **ClosestintegerwithsameNumber.java**: Finds the closest integer that has the same number of set bits (weight) as the given integer.
- **ComputexmulywithoutArithmeticaloper.java**: Computes the product of two integers (x * y) without using standard arithmetic multiplication, division, or bit-shift operators. Likely uses addition and loops.
- **Parity.java**: Calculates the parity of a binary word (number of set bits). It might implement various methods to do this efficiently.
- **ReverseBit.java**: Reverses the bits of a given integer.
- **Reversedigits.java**: Reverses the digits of a decimal integer.
- **checkifdecimalintegerispalindrome.java**: Checks if a decimal integer is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).
- **computexdivy.java**: Computes the division of two integers (x / y) using bitwise operations or subtraction.
- **computexpowy.java**: Computes x raised to the power of y (x^y) efficiently.
- **generaateuniformrandomnumber.java**: Generates a uniform random number within a specified range.
- **intPrimitive.java**: (Likely) Contains various utility functions or demonstrations related to the `int` primitive type.
- **longPrimitive.java**: (Likely) Contains various utility functions or demonstrations related to the `long` primitive type.
- **swapbits.java**: Swaps two specified bits in an integer.
