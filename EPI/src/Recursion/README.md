# Recursive Algorithms

This directory contains Java implementations of various algorithms that utilize recursion. You'll find examples of recursion applied to problems involving arrays, strings, backtracking, and other common patterns.

Below is a breakdown of the subdirectories and key algorithms:

- **Arrays/**: Recursive solutions for array-based problems.
  - `LinearSearch.java`: Implements linear search using recursion.
  - `RotatedBinarySearch.java`: Implements binary search for a rotated sorted array using recursion.
  - `isArraySorted.java`: Checks if an array is sorted using recursion.

- **Backtracking/**: Algorithms that use the backtracking recursive paradigm.
  - `All_Path_Backtracking.java`: Finds all possible paths in a maze (or grid) from a starting point to an end point.
  - `N_Knight.java`: Solves the N-Knights problem (placing N knights on a chessboard so that no two knights attack each other).
  - `N_Queens.java`: Solves the N-Queens problem (placing N queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other).
  - `SudokuSolver.java`: Implements a Sudoku solver using backtracking.
  - `maze_Backtracking.java`: Solves maze problems using backtracking (e.g., finding a path).
  - `maze_restriction.java`: Solves maze problems with specific restrictions or obstacles using backtracking.

- **Pattern/**: Recursive algorithms for generating patterns.
  - `Pattern.java`: Generates various patterns (e.g., triangles) using recursion.

- **String/**: Recursive solutions for string manipulation problems.
  - `Permutation.java`: Generates all permutations of a string.
  - `Skip_a_char.java`: Removes all occurrences of a specific character from a string using recursion.
  - `SubSequence.java`: Generates all subsequences of a string.

- **DigitProduct.java**: Calculates the product of the digits of an integer using recursion.
- **DigitSum.java**: Calculates the sum of the digits of an integer using recursion.
- **Reverse.java**: Reverses an integer using recursion.
- **countZerosin_theint.java**: Counts the number of zeros in an integer using recursion.

- **sorted/**: (Likely related to sorting or checking sorted properties recursively)
  - `BubbleSort.java`: Implements Bubble Sort using recursion.
  - `MergeSort.java`: Implements Merge Sort, a classic divide-and-conquer recursive sorting algorithm.
  - `QuickSort.java`: Implements Quick Sort, another efficient recursive sorting algorithm.

This collection showcases the power and versatility of recursion in solving a wide range of computational problems.
