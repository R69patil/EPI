# Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains Java implementations of common sorting algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in its own file.

Below is a list of the implemented sorting algorithms:

- **CyclicSort.java**: Implements Cyclic Sort, an in-place sorting algorithm that is efficient for arrays containing numbers in a specific range (e.g., 1 to N).
  - *Time Complexity*: O(N) on average and in the worst case.
  - *Space Complexity*: O(1).
- **FindAllDuplicates.java**: While not strictly a sorting algorithm itself, this file likely contains an algorithm that uses sorting-like properties (possibly Cyclic Sort or modification) to find all duplicate numbers in an array, typically where numbers are in a certain range.
- **Main.java**: This file likely contains example usage or testing code for the sorting algorithms in this directory.

Note: For classic sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, please refer to the `EPI/src/Recursion/sorted/` directory, as they are often implemented recursively.
