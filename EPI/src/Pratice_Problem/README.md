# Practice Problems

This directory contains a collection of practice problems and their solutions in Java, covering various topics in data structures and algorithms. These problems are often used to hone specific techniques or to prepare for technical interviews.

Below is a breakdown of the subdirectories and key problem types:

- **Array/**: Practice problems focused on array manipulations and algorithms.
  - `Find_Duplicate_Number.java`: Finds a duplicate number in an array (constraints may vary, e.g., numbers from 1 to N, one duplicate).
  - `Find_pivot_in_rotated_sorted_array.java`: Finds the pivot element in a rotated sorted array. The pivot is the point where the array is "rotated".
  - `FInd_unique_element.java`: Finds the unique element in an array where all other elements appear a certain number of times (e.g., twice).
  - `Search_in_Rotated_Sorted_Array.java`: Searches for an element in a rotated sorted array.

- **Bitwise_Operation/**: Practice problems that can be efficiently solved using bitwise operations.
  - `Find_ith_Bit.java`: Finds the i-th bit (0 or 1) of a given number.
  - `Power.java`: Calculates the power of a number (a^b), possibly using bitwise optimizations.
  - `Power_of_two.java`: Checks if a given number is a power of two.
  - `countSetBit.java`: Counts the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of an integer.

- **Recursion/**: Practice problems designed to be solved using recursion.
  - `Fibonacci_Series.java`: Calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion (and potentially memoization/dynamic programming for optimization).

- **TwoPointer.java**: Implements solutions using the Two Pointer technique, common for problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists where two pointers traverse the data structure.
- **sliding_window.java**: Implements solutions using the Sliding Window technique, often used for problems involving finding optimal substructures (subarrays/substrings) within a larger structure.

This collection provides a good set of problems to practice fundamental algorithmic techniques.
