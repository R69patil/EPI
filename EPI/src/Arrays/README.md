# Array Algorithms

This directory contains Java implementations of various algorithms related to arrays.

Below is a list of the implemented algorithms:

- **AdvancingThroughAnArray.java**: Determines if it's possible to advance from the beginning to the end of an array where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be taken from that position.
- **BasicsArray.java**: Demonstrates basic array operations.
- **DeleteduplicatesfromasortedArray.java**: Deletes duplicate elements from a sorted array.
- **DutuchNationalFlagEnum.java**: Implements the Dutch National Flag problem, which involves partitioning an array into three sections based on a pivot value (e.g., elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot). Uses an enum for colors.
- **IncrementalArbitraryprecisionInteger.java**: Implements an algorithm to increment an arbitrary-precision integer represented as an array of digits.
- **ListPermute.java**: Generates all permutations of a list of elements.
- **MatrixRotation.java**: Rotates a 2D matrix (square array) by 90 degrees.
- **MultiplyLargeNumbers.java**: Multiplies two large numbers represented as arrays of digits.
- **NextPermutationList.java**: Computes the next lexicographical permutation of a list of integers.
- **NonUniformRandom.java**: Generates a random number from a non-uniform distribution.
- **PascalsTriangle.java**: Generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.
- **PrimeNumbersList.java**: Generates a list of prime numbers up to a given limit (Sieve of Eratosthenes).
- **RandomPermutation.java**: Generates a random permutation of an array of integers.
- **RandomSubset.java**: Generates a random subset of a given size from a list.
- **ReservoirSampling.java**: Implements reservoir sampling to select a random sample of k items from a list S containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number.
- **SudokuChecker.java**: Checks if a given Sudoku board is valid.
- **computexmax.java**: (Likely) Computes the maximum value in an array or related to a specific problem. *(Needs further inspection for precise description)*
- **sampleofflinedata.java**: Implements an algorithm for sampling offline data, likely selecting a random subset from a collection of data that is fully available.
- **sprialMatrix.java**: Traverses a 2D matrix in a spiral order.
