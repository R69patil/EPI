# String Algorithms

This directory contains Java implementations of various algorithms for string manipulation and processing.

Below is a list of the implemented algorithms:

- **IsStringPalindromicWithOneDeletion.java**: Checks if a string can become a palindrome by deleting at most one character.
- **LookAndSay.java**: Implements the "Look and Say" sequence generator. (e.g., "1" -> "11" -> "21" -> "1211").
- **PhoneMnemonics.java**: Generates all possible letter combinations (mnemonics) for a given phone number.
- **ReplaceAndRemove.java**: Replaces each 'a' with two 'd's and removes each 'b' from a character array.
- **ReverseWords.java**: Reverses the order of words in a string.
- **RomanToDecimal.java**: Converts a Roman numeral string to its decimal equivalent.
- **RunLengthEncoding.java**: Implements run-length encoding and decoding for strings.
- **SnakeString.java**: Converts a string into a "snake string" pattern (writing characters in a zigzag manner).
- **SpreadsheetColumnEncoding.java**: Converts a spreadsheet column ID (e.g., "A", "B", "AA", "AB") to its corresponding integer and vice-versa.
- **StringIntegerInterconversion.java**: Implements conversion between strings and integers (e.g., "123" to 123 and 123 to "123").
- **SubstringSearch.java**: Implements algorithms for finding occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text string (e.g., naive search, Rabin-Karp).
- **TestPalindromicity.java**: Checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case).
