# Linked List Implementations and Algorithms

This directory contains Java implementations of different types of linked lists and algorithms that operate on them.

Below is a list of the implemented classes and algorithms:

- **Circular_linkedList.java**: Implements a circular linked list data structure.
  - *Operations*: Insertion, deletion, display, search.
- **Doubly_LinkedList.java**: Implements a doubly linked list data structure.
  - *Operations*: Insertion (at head, tail, specific position), deletion (from head, tail, specific position), display (forward and backward), search.
- **Linkedlist.java**: Implements a singly linked list data structure.
  - *Operations*: Insertion (at head, tail, specific position), deletion (from head, tail, specific position), display, search, reverse, find middle, detect loop, etc.
- **main.java**: Contains example usage and testing code for the linked list implementations.

These implementations cover fundamental linked list operations and provide a basis for understanding more complex list-based algorithms.
